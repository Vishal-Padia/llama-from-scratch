# llama-from-scratch
Basically I am trying to implement the LLAMA from scratch.
I'll be following [Brian Kitano's blog](https://blog.briankitano.com/llama-from-scratch/) to implement the scaled down version of [Llama](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971)

Since this is my first time implementing a research paper from scratch, I'll be referring to the blog to understand things like how to start an implemenetation, how to break down the paper in smaller parts, implement those parts modularly and finally combine them to get the final result and much more.

In future, I'll be trying to implement the paper in a more efficient way.
